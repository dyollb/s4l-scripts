This is just a random collection of [Sim4Life](https://zmt.swiss/sim4life/) Python scripts.

Sim4Life is a simulation platform for life science applications to investigate interaction between man-made devices and living organisms (e.g. active implants, mobile phones, neuro-stimulation, thermal heating, ...).
It features a powerful CAD/surface-based modeling environment and GPU accelerated physics solvers, enabling simulations with extremely complex anatomical models, such as the [Virtual Population](https://itis.swiss/virtual-population/virtual-population/overview/).


If you install additional packages, it can be beneficial to create a virtual environment including the s4l modules:
```
"C:\Program Files\Sim4Life_6.2.2.6592\Python\python.exe" -m venv .venv --system-site-packages
```

To activate the virtual environment, type
```
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

Note, if you are using an external editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), most likely it will detect this virtual environment and activate it for you.
